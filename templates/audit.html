<h1 align="center">Monthly Performance Audit laptop and desktop</h1>

<p>A monthly performance audit for laptops and desktops would involve checking for any issues or problems with the devices, such as slow performance, software errors, or hardware malfunctions. This can be done by running diagnostic tests, checking for updates and patches, and monitoring resource usage. The audit may also include checking for compliance with company policies and security protocols, as well as ensuring that the devices are properly configured and optimized for optimal performance. The results of the audit can be used to identify and resolve any issues, and to plan for future upgrades or replacements as needed.</p>
